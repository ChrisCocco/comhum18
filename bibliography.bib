  abstract =  {For a patch of random visual texture embedded in a surrounding background of similar texture, we demonstrate that the perceived contrast of the texture patch depends substantially on the contrast of the background. When the texture patch is surrounded by high-contrast texture, the bright points of the texture patch appear dimmer, and simultaneously, its dark points appear less dark than when it is surrounded by a uniform background. The induced reduction of apparent contrast is greatly diminished when (i) the texture patch and background are filtered into nonoverlapping spatial frequency bands or (ii) the texture patch and background are presented to different eyes. Our results are unanticipated by all current theories of lightness perception and point to a perceptual mechanism for contrast gain control occurring at an early cortical or precortical neural locus.},

Here we show that this puzzling effect can be explained by the degree to which imperfect transmittance is likely to have affected the light that reaches the eye. These observations indicate that this ‘illusion’ is yet another signature of the fundamentally empirical strategy of visual perception, in this case generated by the typical influence of transmittance on inherently ambiguous stimuli. },

However, this notion has been supported primarily by data from languages of industrialized societies. In contrast, recent research on a language from a nonindustrialized society has called this idea into question. We examine color-naming data from languages of 110 nonindustrialized societies and show that (i) best-example choices for color terms in these languages cluster near the prototypes for English white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue, and (ii) best-example choices cluster more tightly across languages than do the centers of category extensions, suggesting that universal best examples (foci) may be the source of universal tendencies in color naming.},

One of the main assumptions advocated in this article is that the structure of color categories originates from the statistical structure
of the perceived color environment that was observed throughout an individual's life. The perceived color environment can be modeled as color statistics of natural images in some perceptual and approximately uniform color space (e.g., the CIELUV color space). The process of color
categorization can be modeled as the grouping of the color statistics by clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means). The proposed computational model enables one to predict the location, rank, and number of color categories. The model is examined on the basis of K-means clustering
analysis of statistics of 630 natural images in the CIELUV color space. In general, the model predictions are consistent with data from psycholinguistic studies. The model might be applied in different areas of imaging science such as color quantization, image quality, and gamut mapping.},

Color is used as a factor in assessing the quality of many agriculture and food products. A system that can simulate human vision in color recognition and output useable quantitative results is therefore desirable. In this study a color analysis method was developed to simulate human color vision by using the Munsell color system. The RGB signal of a color image was transformed to the Munsell color system numerically via the CIE1931 and the CIE1976L*a*b* color systems. Flue-cured tobacco leaf was used to test the method. Results showed that the developed method could simulate human color vision.},
