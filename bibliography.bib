  abstract = {In this paper, a novel hierarchical approach to color image segmentation is studied. We extend the general idea of a histogram to the homogeneity domain. In the first phase of the segmentation, uniform regions are identified via multilevel thresholding on a homogeneity histogram. While we process the homogeneity histogram, both local and global information is taken into consideration. This is particularly helpful in taking care of small objects and local variation of color images. An efficient peak-finding algorithm is employed to identify the most significant peaks of the histogram. In the second phase, we perform histogram analysis on the color feature hue for each uniform region obtained in the first phase. We successfully remove about 99.7% singularity off the original images by redefining the hue values for the unstable points according to the local information. After the hierarchical segmentation is performed, a region merging process is employed to avoid over-segmentation. CIE(L*a*b*) color space is used to measure the color difference. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method after an extensive set of color images was tested.},

  abstract = {We propose a new approach for image segmentation that is based on low-level features for color and texture. It is aimed at segmentation of natural scenes, in which the color and texture of each segment does not typically exhibit uniform statistical characteristics. The proposed approach combines knowledge of human perception with an understanding of signal characteristics in order to segment natural scenes into perceptually/semantically uniform regions. The proposed approach is based on two types of spatially adaptive low-level features. The first describes the local color composition in terms of spatially adaptive dominant colors, and the second describes the spatial characteristics of the grayscale component of the texture. Together, they provide a simple and effective characterization of texture that the proposed algorithm uses to obtain robust and, at the same time, accurate and precise segmentations. The resulting segmentations convey semantic information that can be used for content-based retrieval. The performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated in the domain of photographic images, including low-resolution, degraded, and compressed images.},

When the texture patch is surrounded by high-contrast texture, the bright points of the texture patch appear dimmer, and simultaneously, its dark points appear less dark than when it is surrounded by a uniform background. The induced reduction of apparent contrast is greatly diminished when (i) the texture patch and background are filtered into nonoverlapping spatial frequency bands or (ii) the texture patch and background are presented to different eyes. Our results are unanticipated by all current theories of lightness perception and point to a perceptual mechanism for contrast gain control occurring at an early cortical or precortical neural locus.},

Colors in a given region are clustered into a small number of representative colors. The feature descriptor consists of the representative colors and their percentages in the region. A similarity measure similar to the quadratic color histogram distance measure is defined for this descriptor. The representative colors can be indexed in the three-dimensional (3-D) color space thus avoiding the high-dimensional indexing problems associated with the traditional color histogram. For similarity retrieval, each representative color in the query image or region is used independently to find regions containing that color. The matches from all of the query colors are then combined to obtain the final retrievals. An efficient indexing scheme for fast retrieval is presented. Experimental results show that this compact descriptor is effective and compares favorably with the traditional color histogram in terms of overall computational complexity.},

Experiment 1 tested for categorical responding in 2- to 4-year-olds, the age range for the onset establishment of color term knowledge. Experiment 2 tested for categorical responding in Himba toddlers, whose language segments the color space differently from the way in which the English language does so. Experiment 3 manipulated the conditions of the task to explore whether the categorical responding in Experiments 1 and 2 was equivalent to categorical perception. Categorical perception was shown irrespective of naming and was not stronger in those children with more developed color term knowledge. Cross-cultural differences in the extent of categorical perception were not found. These findings support universalistic models of color categorization and suggest that color term knowledge does not modify categorical perception, at least during the early stages of childhood.},

An objective function which includes a multi-dimensional distance function as the dissimilarity measure and entropy as the regularization term is formulated in the proposed fuzzy co-clustering for images (FCCI) algorithm. The chrominance color cues a⁎ and b⁎ of CIELAB color space are used as the feature variables for co-clustering. The experiments are conducted on 100 natural images obtained from the Berkeley segmentation database. It is observed from the experimental results that the proposed FCCI yields well formed, valid and high quality clusters, as verified from Liu’s F-measure and Normalized Probabilistic RAND index. The proposed color segmentation method is also compared with other segmentation methods namely Mean-Shift, NCUT, GMM, FCM and is found to outperform all the methods. The bacterial foraging global optimization algorithm gives image specific values to the parameters involved in the algorithm.},

Empirical studies on colour preferences generally targeted most preferred colours, but rarely least preferred (disliked) colours. In addition, findings are often based on general colour preferences leaving open the question whether results generalise to specific objects. Here, 88 participants selected the colours they preferred most and least for three context conditions (general, interior walls, t-shirt) using a high-precision colour picker. Participants also indicated whether they associated their colour choice to a valenced object or concept. The chosen colours varied widely between individuals and contexts and so did the reasons for their choices. Consistent patterns also emerged, as most preferred colours in general were more chromatic, while for walls they were lighter and for t-shirts they were darker and less chromatic compared to least preferred colours. This meant that general colour preferences could not explain object specific colour preferences. Measures of the selection process further revealed that, compared to most preferred colours, least preferred colours were chosen more quickly and were less often linked to valenced objects or concepts. The high intra- and inter-individual variability in this and previous reports furthers our understanding that colour preferences are determined by subjective experiences and that most and least preferred colours are not processed equally.},

  abstract =  {It is widely held that named color categories in the world{\textquoteright}s languages are organized around universal focal colors and that these focal colors tend to be chosen as the best examples of color terms across languages. However, this notion has been supported primarily by data from languages of industrialized societies. In contrast, recent research on a language from a nonindustrialized society has called this idea into question. We examine color-naming data from languages of 110 nonindustrialized societies and show that (i) best-example choices for color terms in these languages cluster near the prototypes for English white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue, and (ii) best-example choices cluster more tightly across languages than do the centers of category extensions, suggesting that universal best examples (foci) may be the source of universal tendencies in color naming.},

  abstract =  {Humans parse the continuum of color into discrete categories (e.g., {\textquotedblleft}red{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}blue{\textquotedblright}), and the origin of these categories has been debated for many decades. Here, we provide evidence that infants have color categories for red, yellow, green, blue, and purple. We show that infants{\textquoteright} categorical distinctions align strikingly with those that are commonly made in the world{\textquoteright}s different color lexicons. We also find that infants{\textquoteright} categorical distinctions relate to the activities of the two neural subsystems responsible for the early stages of color representation. These findings suggest that color categorization is partly organized and constrained by the biological mechanisms of color vision and not arbitrarily constructed by language.The biological basis of the commonality in color lexicons across languages has been hotly debated for decades. Prior evidence that infants categorize color could provide support for the hypothesis that color categorization systems are not purely constructed by communication and culture. Here, we investigate the relationship between infants{\textquoteright} categorization of color and the commonality across color lexicons, and the potential biological origin of infant color categories. We systematically mapped infants{\textquoteright} categorical recognition memory for hue onto a stimulus array used previously to document the color lexicons of 110 nonindustrialized languages. Following familiarization to a given hue, infants{\textquoteright} response to a novel hue indicated that their recognition memory parses the hue continuum into red, yellow, green, blue, and purple categories. Infants{\textquoteright} categorical distinctions aligned with common distinctions in color lexicons and are organized around hues that are commonly central to lexical categories across languages. The boundaries between infants{\textquoteright} categorical distinctions also aligned, relative to the adaptation point, with the cardinal axes that describe the early stages of color representation in retinogeniculate pathways, indicating that infant color categorization may be partly organized by biological mechanisms of color vision. The findings suggest that color categorization in language and thought is partially biologically constrained and have implications for broader debate on how biology, culture, and communication interact in human cognition.},

  abstract = {This article presents a framework for understanding, modeling, and computing color categories on the basis of knowledge from the color imaging science. One of the main assumptions advocated in this article is that the structure of color categories originates from the statistical structure
of the perceived color environment that was observed throughout an individual's life. The perceived color environment can be modeled as color statistics of natural images in some perceptual and approximately uniform color space (e.g., the CIELUV color space). The process of color
categorization can be modeled as the grouping of the color statistics by clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means). The proposed computational model enables one to predict the location, rank, and number of color categories. The model is examined on the basis of K-means clustering
analysis of statistics of 630 natural images in the CIELUV color space. In general, the model predictions are consistent with data from psycholinguistic studies. The model might be applied in different areas of imaging science such as color quantization, image quality, and gamut mapping.},

The present study extends this work by showing that children as young as 3 years old detect consistent relationships between colours and facial expressions of emotions – two phenomena that share no physical characteristics, violate conventional categories and have no obvious environmental contiguity. Two explanatory hypotheses are put forward: (a) learning by convention, which is explored against the standard of adults’ and older children’s matching patterns, and (b) reliance upon a common underlying but perceptually unavailable dimension – operationalized in terms of emotion and colour preferences in the context of the present study. Both explanatory approaches are discussed and avenues for future work are suggested.},

Color is used as a factor in assessing the quality of many agriculture and food products. A system that can simulate human vision in color recognition and output useable quantitative results is therefore desirable. In this study a color analysis method was developed to simulate human color vision by using the Munsell color system. The RGB signal of a color image was transformed to the Munsell color system numerically via the CIE1931 and the CIE1976L*a*b* color systems. Flue-cured tobacco leaf was used to test the method. Results showed that the developed method could simulate human color vision.},

Accordingly, large corpora of 3D models, such as the Google 3D Warehouse, are now becoming freely available on the web. How to find the proper 3D urban models is a challenging research issue. In this paper, we join shape descriptors and color descriptors for 3D urban model retrieval. The query objects are localized and segmented automatically from the input images by using a new selective search voting algorithm. Through combining the normalization with the light field descriptor, the Horizontal Light Descriptor is introduced to measure the shape similarity among the normalized urban models. The color descriptors are used to represent the color information of the urban models. The two types of descriptors are joined to search 3D urban models similar to the query objects. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our approach. },
